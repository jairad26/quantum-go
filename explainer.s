Quantum computing is based on qubits, quantum states, quantum gates, and quantum circuits.

## Qubits
A qubit is the basic unit of quantum information. It is a two-level quantum system that can exist in a superposition of states. 
The state of a qubit can be represented as a linear combination of the basis states |0⟩ and |1⟩, denoted as α|0⟩ + β|1⟩, 
where α and β are complex numbers, used to represent the quantum state of the qubit.

## Quantum States
A quantum state is a vector in a complex vector space that represents the state of a quantum system.
The state of a quantum system can be represented as a superposition of basis states, where the coefficients of the 
basis states are complex numbers, representing the amplitude.

## Quantum Gates
Quantum gates are the building blocks of quantum circuits. They are unitary operators that act on qubits to perform operations.
Quantum gates can be used to manipulate the quantum state of qubits, entangle qubits, and perform quantum computations.

### Common Quantum Gates
- Pauli-X gate: Flips the state of a qubit from |0⟩ to |1⟩ and vice versa.
- Hadamard gate: Creates a superposition of |0⟩ and |1⟩ states.
- CNOT gate: Entangles two qubits, where the state of one qubit depends on the state of the other qubit.

## Quantum Circuits
A quantum circuit is a sequence of quantum gates applied to qubits to perform quantum computations.
